Hello! I&rsquo;m Jeng — a Master&rsquo;s student studying at Singapore Management University in Quantitative Finance. I have my aspirations set on being a quant, and I have so much more to learn. This place will be my Great Library of Alexandria, where I store the many thoughts and invaluable knowledge throughout my journey.
Currently, I&rsquo;m exploring these areas:

Artificial intelligence (machine learning & neural networks) in finance.
Research and development of trading strategies in financial markets.

Hobbies & Interests
I love sports and video games. You can bet on finding me in one of these activities during my free time. I play squash competitively in Singapore&rsquo;s National Squash League and am a casual high-rank player (Top 0.01% in South East Asia) in Dota 2. Other sports and games include badminton, table tennis, cycling, League of Legends, Counter Strike and more!"><meta name=author content="Me"><link rel=canonical href=http://localhost:1313/blog/about/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/blog/assets/css/stylesheet.ed301bed040a5191d2bfe40afbacc088f15d10d94fa5db752c30909e7b1d2f77.css integrity="sha256-7TAb7QQKUZHSv+QK+6zAiPFdENlPpdt1LDCQnnsdL3c=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=http://localhost:1313/blog/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=http://localhost:1313/blog/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=http://localhost:1313/blog/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=http://localhost:1313/blog/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=http://localhost:1313/blog/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=http://localhost:1313/blog/about/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="http://localhost:1313/blog/about/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="limjeng"><meta property="og:title" content="About Me"><meta property="og:description" content="Welcome!
